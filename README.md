## Description
This text editor allows the user to download an app to use offline. The user can then add, update and delete text notes in the app. 


## Technologies
Requires npm and uses express. The application should be deployed to Heroku but there is a known error with Heroku at the moment where it is not recognizing Node files. For this reason, I have added screenshots and a walk through video of the deployed application. 

## User-Guide
To get started, in your terminal, type in 'npm run start'
<br>
<br>
<br>
Screenshot of the app on my localhost/port:3000 :

<br>
<br>
<br>
The app is already downloaded so this is what it looks like when prompted to open:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The application itself:

<br>
<br>
<br>
The error being thrown from Heroku - which is really too bad. Once Heroku fixes the issue I will update:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Click on the video (below) to view the app being run through my local server. Once on the server- you can type in notes and then click on the install button. Because I've already installed the app, I just need to open it. Once opened you can see it is just a single page, it has the ability to run offline and still saves the updates to the text notes.
